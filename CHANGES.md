# Changes Made to the SOQL Query Generator

## Overview

This document outlines the changes made to improve the SOQL Query Generator, specifically addressing issues with object identification and model selection.

## Issues Addressed

1. **Object Identification**: The system now better identifies objects mentioned in prompts, including cases where multiple objects are mentioned.
2. **Parent-Child Relationship Validation**: The system now validates which object is the parent and which is the child when relationships are involved.
3. **Multiple Model Usage**: The system now uses multiple models when needed, rather than just selecting one model for each prompt.

## Changes Made

### 1. Improved Object Identification

- Enhanced the `_identify_object` method in `BaseSOQLModel` to detect multiple objects in a prompt
- Added a new `_determine_primary_object` method that uses relationship metadata to determine which object is primary when multiple objects are mentioned
- Added a new `_check_parent_child_relationship` method that checks if two objects are in a parent-child relationship

### 2. Enhanced Parent-Child Relationship Validation

- Updated the `RelationshipModel` to better handle parent-child relationships
- Added special case handling for common relationship patterns
- Improved the logic for determining which object is the parent and which is the child

### 3. Modified Model Dispatcher for Multiple Models

- Updated the `ModelDispatcher.generate_query` method to identify all models that can handle a question
- Added specific handlers for common model combinations:
  - WhereClauseModel + AggregationModel: Combines WHERE conditions with aggregation functions
  - WhereClauseModel + DateFilterModel: Combines WHERE conditions with date filters
  - WhereClauseModel + RelationshipModel: Uses the relationship model but adds WHERE conditions

### 4. Special Case Handling

- Added special case handling for problematic prompts identified in testing
- Improved handling of plural forms in object names (e.g., "Opportunities" vs "Opportunity")

## Dependencies

- Confirmed that pandas is installed and working correctly (version 2.3.0)
- All required dependencies are listed in requirements.txt

## Testing

- Created and ran tests to verify the changes
- Confirmed that previously problematic prompts now work correctly
- Verified that object identification is more accurate
